# TheCardCounters

Team Name:
TheCardCounters

Proposed Level of Achievement:
Apollo 11

Motivation:
Theres is no good resource available to practice card counting in BlackJack. Card counting is
a strategy used by skilled players to track the distribution of cards in the deck and adjust their betting accordingly. Keeping track of the cards allows players to predict whether the next card will be high or low and adjust their bets accordingly, increasing their chances of winning.
Card counting apps can make the process easier and more efficient, allowing players to
make better decisions and potentially win more money.

Aim:
We aspire for our application to become an educational platform for avid BlackJack
enthusiasts and newbies alike (target audience). We hope it becomes their go-to resource in learning the art of card-counting and basic BlackJack strategies through quizzes and forums.
Our application will teach the fundamentals of card counting, such as assigning values to
cards, keeping a running count, and adjusting bets based on the count using sophisticated
skillsets of mathematics. Possible expansions of our application could make room for
card-counting practice exercises, game simulations, as well as innovative tools to track
progress and refine their card-counting strategies. We will also implement a leaderboard for
users to track their overall progress vis-a-vis their online friends. This will create a culture of accountability for our users. The application's goal is to assist users in improving their ability to count cards accurately and use this skill to increase their chances of winning at the card table.

Features for the Next Phase:

1. Practice Quizzes: The app might include a range of practice exercises, such as
quizzes and games that replicate the game of blackjack, to assist users hone their
card counting abilities.
2. Forum: A platform for users to communicate and discuss strategies with one another.
3. Analytics and Tracking: The software could keep tabs on the user's progress and
offer data on how well they were card counting, such as their average bet, win/loss
ratio, and other metrics.
4. Real-Time Counting: The app might provide a real-time counting function that lets
users practice card counting while playing blackjack at a casino or online.
5. Simulations: To help users understand how different count values affect the
probability of winning, the app might feature simulations of genuine blackjack games.
